# Todoist - Enough

A Raycast extension that helps you focus on what you've accomplished by showing your completed Todoist tasks.

## Features

- **Daily View**: See all tasks you've completed today, organized by project
- **Weekly View**: Review your accomplishments from the past 7 days
- **Project Organization**: Tasks are grouped by project with task counts
- **Priority Indicators**: Visual indicators show task priorities
- **Personal Focus**: Only shows tasks you completed (excludes shared/group tasks)
- **Completion Dates**: Shows when each task was completed
- **Search**: Quickly find specific completed tasks

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension
2. Add your Todoist API token (found in Todoist Settings > Integrations > API token)
3. Use the commands:
   - `See Daily Completed Tasks` to view today's accomplishments
   - `See Weekly Completed Tasks` to view the past week's accomplishments

## Why "Enough"?

Sometimes we focus too much on what's left to do, rather than appreciating what we've already accomplished. This extension helps you see that you've done enough today by showing your completed tasks.
